                <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl my-2">How I became fascinated by health</h2>
                <p>I've struggled with my health, both physical and mental. So I understand the impact health has on our overall happiness and quality of life.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In my mid-20s, I had a myriad of health problems that I refused to believe were caused by stress. Spoiler alert, they were. Thanks to my stubbornness, I was headed for debilitating panic attacks, burnout and depression. My body had to literally shut down for me to start listening to it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>That's when I realised how everything was connected and I wanted to understand how our bodies and minds work. So I took an evening class that covered both anatomy and psychology. I was fascinated by the intelligent and intricate machines our bodies are and how important it is to maintain our machines. I also wanted to help people avoid all the shit I had been through. That led me to a health coaching course and here we are.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl my-2">My vision</h2>
                <p>I love being able to help people make the changes they need to be healthier and happier. Because what is more important in life?!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>My goal as a health coach is to help people understand how our bodies and minds work and help them achieve better health and happiness. I believe good health is supported by four pillars: nutrition, exercise, mental wellbeing and sleep. I also know from experience that changing behaviour is hard work. That's why I emphasise the importance of habits, routines and motivation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>There are many different interpretations of coaching. How I see it is that I'm a guide that can take you from where you are to where you want to be. I believe that we are all unique and we all know what's best for ourselves. That's why I don't just give general advice. I'll give you the knowledge and tools you need to make informed decisions and ask questions to help you find your own answers.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>If you'd like some support in creating healthy habits, I'd love to be your health coach!
